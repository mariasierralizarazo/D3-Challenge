# D3-Challenge
### Using D3 and Javascript for dinamic data visualization 

D3 is a JavaScript library that combines power visualization components (DOM manipulation) for bringing data to life. This library is pretty advance for doing data visualization using all the advantages of modern browsers. 
<br>
For more information an examples: <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3 website</a>.
The main goal in this project was to generate a dynamic and interactive graph with the provided <a href="https://github.com/mariasierralizarazo/D3-Challenge/blob/master/assets/data/data.csv">data</a>. In that way, the user will be able to understand, interact, and analyze the relation between Poverty Percentage or Median Age - located on the x-axis- and Smokes Percentage or Lacks of Healthcare Percentage - located on the y-axis-. <br>
As it is being shown in the next figure, the user will interact and select what he/she wants to see, and the data per state - represented with circles- will be updated. <br>

<br>
Also, when the user points the mouse on top of a circle, information related to the state and the data point is displayed, so it helps the final user to have better information.
